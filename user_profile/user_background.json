          "context": "As Robinhood expanded its Futures trading capabilities to international markets, a critical requirement emerged â€” the backend services handling Futures and Event contracts were originally built with U.S.-specific assumptions around contract types, market hours, timezones, and regulatory compliance. To support global trading, the platform needed to be refactored and extended for internationalization (i18n), ensuring it could dynamically serve users across multiple regions with varying exchange configurations and asset definitions. This project was prioritized as foundational infrastructure work for Robinhood's global trading roadmap.",
          "action": "I led the effort by first designing the technical architecture for the internationalization framework and authored a comprehensive design document, which was reviewed and approved by the team's tech lead. The design introduced region-aware abstractions and a flexible data access pattern to support localized behavior without disrupting existing functionality. I implemented both service-layer and database-level regional sharding to isolate data paths by geography, improving scalability and data integrity. This involved updating core service logic and refactoring all relevant Kafka producer and consumer pipelines to handle region-specific routing, schema validation, and fault-tolerant delivery. Throughout the process, I collaborated cross-functionally with product, compliance, and SRE teams to align on requirements, rollout plans, and operational safety.",
          "achievement": "The internationalized backend framework was successfully launched, enabling Robinhood to support region-specific Futures and Event contracts for the first time. This unlocked the path to global expansion in derivatives trading and established the foundation for future cross-market features. The modular, sharded architecture has already been reused for new regional launches, significantly accelerating onboarding for additional markets. This project demonstrates my ability to drive technical design, lead cross-functional execution, and modernize infrastructure for long-term scalability."

          "context": "The Legal and Operations teams raised critical compliance concerns regarding the lifecycle of users' Futures accounts. Our team owned both the account management service and the underlying account data, placing us in a central role to resolve these risks. Key issues included ensuring users with specific tax-related statuses were appropriately restricted from trading, and that any suspension of a user's brokerage account would cascade to their Futures account as required by regulatory standards. Addressing these concerns was urgent to maintain legal compliance and avoid potential issues during external audits.",
          "action": "I took ownership of the project and began by working closely with Legal and Ops stakeholders to translate regulatory requirements into concrete technical rules. I designed and implemented a solution that combined incremental batch jobs with Kafka stream consumers, enabling our systems to update Futures account statuses in near real-time based on external triggers (e.g., brokerage account suspensions, tax status changes). Additionally, I developed a daily reconciliation job to detect and correct any inconsistencies between the authoritative brokerage account state and the Futures system. These changes were implemented with careful attention to auditability and rollback safety, including detailed logging and operational dashboards for monitoring.",
          "achievement": "The system enhancements I delivered fully addressed the legal and operational compliance concerns, reducing regulatory risk and ensuring the Futures platform was audit-ready. The new processes now guarantee that only eligible users can access Futures trading, and that suspensions are enforced promptly and accurately. This project exemplifies my ability to translate ambiguous compliance requirements into robust, scalable systems, and to proactively protect the business from regulatory exposure."

It is a critical service that generates recommendation strategies for various surfaces such as retail websites, fire tablet, kindle stores, etc. The average TPS for the service is over 1 million per second. The main issue for this service is that is over 10 years old and it is based on some very outdated technologies such as VM-based hosts, hardware-based load balancer, manual scaling for peak events, etc. The operational burden of this service is very high, and the oncall engineers have to wait up in the mid of the night to fix issues on this service. To address this issue, our org established a core team with several senior SDEs, the goal is to migrate this Tier-1 service into using more advanced technologies by using native AWS.",
          "action": "I'm always interested in infra related projects, and I noticed the huge impact of this migration project that aligns perfectly with my interest. So I volunteered to join the core team and worked on several key tasks on this project. One task involved to migrate part of the service logics to NAWS by establish a new service using AWS ECS. I created the infra using AWS CDK, added CI/CD pipelines and monitoring to make sure the new service meets the Tier-1 requirements, such as five-night reliability, P90 latency under 200ms, etc. The other task is to migrate the load balancer from old hardware LB to AWS ALB. During the migration, unexpected network routing issues arose, threatening to delay the project. I took the initiative to troubleshoot the configuration errors, leveraging both documentation and consultation with cross-team network specialists. I carefully validated each change in a test environment to minimize risks before implementing it in production. To ensure no service disruptions, I established a detailed rollback plan and monitored the migration closely during the cutover.",
          "achievement": "I successfully migrated over 50% of this Tier-1 services into the more advanced native AWS infra, which reduced infra cost by over 30%. During the migration, I also fixed multiple legacy issues in the code base. Besides the new service is also autoscaling. These efforts helped to reduce the operation cost and oncall burden by 25% reduction of oncall tickets."
